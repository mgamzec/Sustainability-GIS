- Geopandas combines the capabilities of the data analysis library pandas with other packages like shapely and fiona for managing spatial data. The main data structures in geopandas are GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame which extend the capabilities of Series and DataFrames from pandas.

- The main difference between GeoDataFrames and pandas DataFrames is that a GeoDataFrame should contain (at least) one column for geometries. By default, the name of this column is 'geometry'. The geometry column is a GeoSeries which contains the geometries (points, lines, polygons, multipolygons etc.) as shapely objects.
